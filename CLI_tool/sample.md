# Markdown to HTML CLI Tool (Rust Project)

This is my first Rust project! 🎉  
It is a command-line tool that converts Markdown files into HTML format.

---

## ✨ Features
- Accepts Markdown input from a file
- Converts Markdown into HTML using a Rust library (e.g., `pulldown_cmark` or `comrak`)
- Outputs a clean and styled HTML document
- Simple and beginner-friendly CLI

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Rust** programming language
- **Cargo** for package & project management
- **Markdown parser crate** (like pulldown-cmark)
- **Maud** (or HTML template rendering crate — whichever you used)

---

## 📌 Purpose
This project helps me learn:
- Rust syntax & ownership concepts
- Working with external crates
- File I/O handling in Rust
- Building real CLI tools

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Support for images, lists & tables
- Live preview in browser
- Custom HTML themes
- Command-line flags for more options
