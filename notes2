//Lifetime - Three Golden Points
//The primary objective of lifetimes in Rust is to avoid dangling references
//Rust reject code that could lead to memory safety issues.
//When there is a reference, there may be a chance of a dangling reference — and Rust uses lifetimes to prevent that

Dangling Reference
A dangling reference occurs when a program tries to access data that has already been deallocated or gone out of scope, leading to undefined behavior and potential memory safety issues.
By tracking the scope for which a reference is valid, Rust's borrow checker can enforce rules at compile time, guaranteeing memory safety without runtime overhead.
